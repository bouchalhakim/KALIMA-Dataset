# KALIMA-Dataset

To support the development of deep learning models, large datasets with precise ground truth annotations are essential for training and evaluating different methods. Although recent efforts have produced a variety of datasets tailored for specific tasks, there remains a notable gap in the availability of comprehensive datasets with diverse annotation schemes suitable for multiple applications. In response, we have undertaken the creation of a meticulously annotated dataset, specifically designed to facilitate text line detection and recognition.

KALIMA is a public data collection comprised of 116 manuscript pages from a diverse selection of texts, each representing different styles, topics, and periods. These pages have been meticulously annotated with bounding boxes and corresponding ground-truth transcriptions. The bounding box annotation process was carried out by multiple individuals proficient in Arabic. Each annotation underwent a verification stage by a different person, with potential exclusions, before being finalized for inclusion in the dataset. For the text component, we focused solely on manuscripts where the text has been checked and validated by experts.
